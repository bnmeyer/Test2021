Insert	into pagetext values ('footer',2,'As good as this parenting research is, our challenge is that the research is neither promptly nor prospectively available for most parents.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('home',1,'Why are the early years important?');
Insert	into pagetext values ('home',2,'The first years are critical for building healthy brains. Children''s early experiences and environment play a large role in their skill development and later school success. Unfortunately, not all children receive the early care and attention they need to succeed.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('home',3,'Why are parenting practices important?');
Insert	into pagetext values ('home',4,'Parents are the most important people in young children''s lives. They play an integral role in fostering early skill development and learning. What’s most exciting is that parenting skills are not just inborn, but can be taught.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('home',5,'The challenge');
Insert	into pagetext values ('home',6,'Unfortunately, evidence suggests the achievement gap begins at birth, even if we are only able to measure it later. It is clear that most adults do not have the knowledge of child development needed to help their children thrive, and we lack a mechanism to teach parenting knowledge at scale.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('home',7,'One innovative approach might be...');
Insert	into pagetext values ('home',8,'According to economists, early investment produces abundant returns in human capital. However, parenting knowledge, necessary from the day a child is born, is not typically available in any formal way to U.S. citizens. Since high school is our last chance to reach everyone, the approach is to teach parenting in high schools so every child is born to a parent that understands the vital role he or she plays in shaping that child''s future.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('why',1,'WHY ARE THE EARLY YEARS IMPORTANT?');
Insert	into pagetext values ('why',2,'“Healthy development in the early years (particularly birth to three) provides the building blocks for educational achievement, economic productivity, responsible citizenship, lifelong health, strong communities, and successful parenting of the next generation (National Scientific Council on the Developing Child, 2020).”');
Insert	into pagetext values ('why',3,'Gaps are large on entering kindergarten');
Insert	into pagetext values ('why',4,'Income-based achievement gaps in basic skills such as math and reading are already large when children enter kindergarten (Reardon, 2013; von Hippel & Hamrock, 2016) so it is reasonable that focusing on young children''s learning in the early years when the gaps grow may lead to ways of preventing them (O''Donnell Weber, 2019).');
Insert	into pagetext values ('why',5,'Science is accumulating for the early years');
Insert	into pagetext values ('why',6,'Researchers from numerous scientific disciplines are accumulating results from different directions on the importance of the early years. Neuroscience research on brain plasticity, investigations of the prenatal period by biologists and health scientists, psychologists'' and sociologists'' longitudinal studies and much more all point in the same direction: the importance of the early years.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('why',7,'Economics of Early Learning');
Insert	into pagetext values ('why',8,'James Heckman, Director of the Center for the Economics of Human Development and 2000 Nobel prize winner in economics, has spoken often about the economics of early learning. Here is a brief summary of what he said June 29, 2009 at the Chautauqua gathering:');
Insert	into pagetext values ('why',9,'What we’ve learned is that if society intervenes early enough, it can raise cognitive and social emotional abilities. The rates of return on these investments, if we put it in a purely economic setting, range between 7 and 10 percent compared with a corresponding return on equity investments of less than 6 percent. So, the rate of return on investment is very high. It competes with any social program and is much better than infrastructure, much better than building bridges and much better than fixing potholes. In short, fixing people and creating a base for future productivity and motivation for the society has a very high economic and social return.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('scienceaccumulating',1,'A profusion of science is accumulating from many disciplines for the early years');
Insert	into pagetext values ('scienceaccumulating',2,'Researchers from many branches of scientific endeavor are accumulating research on the importance of the early years.  Genomicists'' work in biological embedding, economists studying the economics of human potential, medical clinicians investigating sources of health risks, and much more all point in the same direction: the importance of the early years.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('scienceaccumulating',3,'Psychology and Social Science');
Insert	into pagetext values ('scienceaccumulating',4,'From Vygotsky’s learning theory and Piaget’s learning from within, through the Perry Preschool and Abecedarian projects of the late 1960s and after, to Hart and Risley’s “Disparities in Early Vocabulary Growth (1995), psychologists and sociologists have played a central role in our understanding of early learning and ECE. More recently, psychologists and sociologists have found educational experiences including social and emotional learning in the early years are important for later success in school (Hartman, Winsler and Manfra, 2017) and beyond (Janta, van Belle and Steward, 2016) further emphasizing the early years for building a foundation for future learning and life. A meta-analysis by O’Connor, de Feyter and others (2017), in research for the U.S. Department of Education, found “Decades of developmental and educational research show that students’ social and emotional competence is not only important in its own right (early behavior problems are the greatest predictor of long-term negative outcomes like incarceration, substance abuse, and unemployment), but also improves students’ academic performance (p. 3).”');
Insert	into pagetext values ('scienceaccumulating',5,'Genomics');
Insert	into pagetext values ('scienceaccumulating',6,'Accumulating evidence suggests the human brain has windows of sensitivity to negative events and conditions, especially in infancy and even in pre-natal periods. Adverse events in these periods can lead to what is referred to by genomicists as biological embedding which may cause abnormal cognitive and behavioral functioning, including impaired learning, memory, and depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, as well as other negative outcomes later in life (Vaiserman and Koliada, 2017).');
Insert	into pagetext values ('scienceaccumulating',7,'Clinical Medicine');
Insert	into pagetext values ('scienceaccumulating',8,'In perhaps the watershed study on the subject (number of citations > 13,000 per Google Scholar, 2021) Dr. Vincent Felitti and associates showed persons who have experienced exposure to four or more categories of adverse childhood experiences, “compared to those who had experienced none, had 4- to 12-fold increased health risks for alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, and suicide attempt; a 2- to 4-fold increase in smoking, poor self-rated health, ≥50 sexual intercourse partners, and sexually transmitted disease; and a 1.4- to 1.6-fold increase in physical inactivity and severe obesity (Felitti et al, 1998, p. 245).”');
Insert	into pagetext values ('scienceaccumulating',9,'Epidemiology');
Insert	into pagetext values ('scienceaccumulating',10,'Biological embedding is generally applied to early life adversities “such as child maltreatment, caregiver stress or depression, and domestic or community violence” which epidemiological studies have shown are associated with adverse outcomes later in life. These outcomes include increased risk of “diabetes, heart disease, cancers and psychiatric illnesses (Berens, Jensen, and Nelson, 2017, p. 135).”');
Insert	into pagetext values ('scienceaccumulating',11,'Biological and Health Sciences');
Insert	into pagetext values ('scienceaccumulating',12,'The rapidly advancing frontiers of 21st-century biological sciences now provide compelling evidence that the foundations of lifelong health are also built early, with increasing evidence of the importance of the prenatal period and first few years after birth (National Scientific Council on the Developing Child, 2020).”');
Insert	into pagetext values ('scienceaccumulating',13,'Economics');
Insert	into pagetext values ('scienceaccumulating',14,'"Much evidence suggests that investing in early childhood development—in the early formation of skills that produce valuable and productive individuals and in strengthening the parenting resources of American families—is one of the smartest ways to create a better economy and stronger society for all (Heckman, 2013)."');
Insert	into pagetext values ('scienceaccumulating',15,'Neuroscience');
Insert	into pagetext values ('scienceaccumulating',16,'Plasticity is the characteristic of the brain to modify its neural structure and pathways, for better or worse, in response to external stimuli (i.e., good or bad experiences). These external experiences affect brain development in much of life and significantly in the early years. Neuroscience has identified periods of sensitivity in the early years, during which the human brain is particularly equipped to gain facility with a specific set of knowledge or for a skill or ability. After this window closes, learning or acquiring the facility becomes very difficult or even impossible.  For example, nearly all children learn their native language effortlessly with appropriate grammar and pronunciation. Others who come to a language later in life have difficulty mastering grammar, pronouncing words and acquiring vocabulary – the process has become laborious and fundamentally limited (Power and Schlaggar, 2017, p. 9; Krageloh-Mann, I., 2004, p. 84). ');
Insert	into pagetext values ('earlyyears',1,'The first years are critical for building healthy brains');
Insert	into pagetext values ('earlyyears',2,'More than 80% of a child''s brain forms during the first three years of life and the formation of neural connections is fastest at birth and slows over time. Since brain development is incredibly malleable, the inputs that the child receives, including adequate nutrition, love and care, and stimulation from the parents during this critical period have lasting effects on a child''s brain development!');
Insert	into pagetext values ('earlyyears',3,'Children''s early experiences and environment play a large role in their skill development and later school success');
Insert	into pagetext values ('earlyyears',4,'According to Harvard''s Center on the Developing Child, "early experiences affect the development of brain architecture, which provides the foundation for all future learning, behavior, and health." Educational experiences including social and emotional learning and the learning environment that parents provide in the early years have been found to be vitally important for later success in school and beyond further emphasizing the early years for building a foundation for future learning and life.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('earlyyears',5,'Unfortunately, some children don’t receive the early care and attention they need to succeed');
Insert	into pagetext values ('earlyyears',6,'When children don''t receive adequate care and stimulation in the early years they are at risk of underperformance when they begin school. Recent studies indicate that the income-based achievement gaps in cognitive skills such as math and reading are fully substantiated at the time children enter kindergarten. What''s worse, children who start behind often stay behind.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('parenting',1,'Parents are the most important people in young children’s lives');
Insert	into pagetext values ('parenting',2,'In the United States, more children are in the daily care of a parent than in day care centers or in the care of other adults and relatives. So, not only are parents and children spending lots of time together, but the unique bond between parents and their children make every interaction more meaningful and with the potential for more powerful impacts.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('parenting',3,'Parents play an integral role in fostering early skill development and learning');
Insert	into pagetext values ('parenting',4,'Parents and their children not only share the most incredible bond of love, but they also have incredible potential to shape young children’s early environment and experiences. Sadly, the early achievement gap begins in the home, and therefore we must help parents to create conditions where young children can thrive.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('parenting',5,'We can learn to be better parents');
Insert	into pagetext values ('parenting',6,'Parents who know more about parenting and child development and who have a stronger belief they can make a difference in their child’s development, are more apt to interact with their children in ways promoting learning than parents with less parenting knowledge (Rowe, 2008). This suggests that by helping parents learn more about parenting, child development, and their own power to impact their children, parents can contribute to improved outcomes for their children.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('thechallenge',1,'The achievement gap begins at birth');
Insert	into pagetext values ('thechallenge',2,'Children born into low-income households are disadvantaged from birth. By the time we are able to measure differences in skills and knowledge, gaps in abilities are already well established. For example, from when they are born, some children hear exponentially more words from their parents and caregivers than other children, and this has enormous effects on their language development, literacy development, and later success in school.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('thechallenge',3,'Most adults do not have general knowledge of child development');
Insert	into pagetext values ('thechallenge',4,'A recent study from Zero to Three and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation attempted to understand what a national sample of American adults knows about child development, revealing that more than half of the sample of U.S. voters reported that they know little or nothing about child development, while at the same time nine out of ten believe that knowledge of the topic is important.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('thechallenge',5,'Parenting knowledge is not typically available in any formal way to U.S. citizens');
Insert	into pagetext values ('thechallenge',6,'There is currently no formal way to prepare people for parenthood. Motivated parents may sign up for childbirth and baby care classes when they are expecting, and negligent parents may be referred to parenting classes by child services. The intervention programs that target parenting knowledge and practices in low-income families — an approach that has been successful, yet costly — only reaches a subset of parents. Instead, the vast majority of parents are simply expected “just to know” what to do to nurture their children.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('opportunity',1,'The opportunity is to teach parenting in high schools');
Insert	into pagetext values ('opportunity',2,'Teaching parenting and child development in high schools allows reaching virtually all Americans and thereby takes a proactive approach of success from early childhood and beyond.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('opportunity',3,'High school is our last chance to reach everyone');
Insert	into pagetext values ('opportunity',4,'No civic organizations have the same reach as our public school system, and high school is often the last site where virtually all citizens participate. Moreover, school is already the main apparatus for preparing students for civic life and is a key site of socialization, including around public health issues like drunk driving and substance abuse.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('opportunity',5,'Early investment produces abundant returns in human capital');
Insert	into pagetext values ('opportunity',6,'According to Nobel Prize winning economist James Heckman, the earlier the investment, the greater the return: "Invest in prevention, not remediation. Invest in flourishing lives, not in correcting problems after they appear." Comprehensive, early childhood development is key to later success in education and life. Programs that start at birth (or even before!) strengthen families and society.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('opportunity',7,'But, more research is needed...');
Insert	into pagetext values ('opportunity',8,'There has been a huge increase in our understanding of the importance of young children attending early learning centers. Why has there been no similar increase in our understanding of early learning in the home?');
Insert	into pagetext values ('opportunity',9,'What are the most important social and emotional learning competencies young children could acquire and what are the optimal acquisition ages?  How might we begin systematically tackling this broad topic?');
Insert	into pagetext values ('opportunity',10,'The State of Utah is the only state in which we’ve found a significant program proactively and widely teaching adolescents parenting and child development. What outcomes have resulted?');
Insert	into pagetext values ('opportunity',11,'Over the past 20 years science has generated literally thousands of parenting research reports but teens say they learn about parenting not from the research or research based books or courses but from their friends, their parents or TV (O''Donnell Weber and Rowe, 2018).

Insert	into pagetext values ('ourwork',3,'History');
Insert	into pagetext values ('ourwork',4,'It started as just one simple idea: What if we tackled the achievement gap by preparing people to be parents before having children? We are committed to helping those disadvantaged and yet we also realized this might help all children. Today, we''re funding new research to learn what high school students know and believe about parenting and child development, to understand the efficacy of teaching parenting at the secondary level, and the efficacy of SEL in the early years.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('ourwork',5,'Activities');
Insert	into pagetext values ('ourwork',6,'Grants are available for researchers interested in adding to knowledge of the effectiveness of teaching parenting at the secondary level defined broadly and SEL in the early years.

Insert	into pagetext values ('history',1,'PROJECT HISTORY');
Insert	into pagetext values ('history',2,'The work of Strengthening Future Families began in 2015 when members of Early Education Research Foundation and United Way of Northern New Jersey circulated a white paper about teaching parenting in our school systems. Throughout the remainder of 2015 and 2016 Bruce Meyer of EERF and Kathy Kwasnik of UWNNJ continued considering possibilities for strengthening early childhood education and care through teaching parenting and received much appreciated interest and encouragement from John Franklin, Kiran Gaudioso and Michelle Roers of UWNNJ; Cynthia Rice at Advocates for Children of New Jersey; Steven Barnett and Valerie Werstler of the National Institute for Early Education Research; Ellen Galinsky of Families and Work Institute; Richard De Lisi of Rutgers Graduate School of Education, and many others.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('history',3,'In late 2016 Meyer and Kwasnik connected with Meredith Rowe of Harvard’s GSE and in 2018 Rowe and her graduate student, Nell O’Donnell Weber, began studying what American high school students know and believe about parenting and child development. They developed, validated, and administered a survey of 1,044 students from across the United States in proportions reflecting the composition and distribution of young people in America. The results of this study are currently under review for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('history',4,'In 2019 we developed a curriculum framework of the essential knowledge for high school students about how young children learn and the best ways to foster their development. This was based on the results of the survey and the latest research on what knowledge and attitudes are most strongly associated with optimal outcomes for young children. We are currently seeking high schools to pilot this curriculum with their students.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('history',5,'Today, we invite researchers, schools, districts, teachers, parents, and students to join us in this work. Together, we can have a significant impact helping the next generation of parents prepare for their important work.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('activities',1,'Research Grants');
Insert	into pagetext values ('activities',2,'Next is to learn more about the efficacy of teaching parenting and child development in high schools. To do this, each year starting in 2021, we''re offering four grants of up to $55,000 each for organizations led by researchers and research teams interested in how we can better prepare the next generation of parents through our public schools. The goal is improving participant''s children''s kindergarten readiness and success in school and life.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('activities',3,'Partnerships');
Insert	into pagetext values ('activities',4,'We welcome partnerships with schools and school districts, research centers, charitable organizations, universities, and others striving to understand the possibilities of teaching parenting at the secondary level and SEL in the early years. If you are associated with a U.S. high school and would like to learn about our pilot test program, we''re especially interested in talking with you.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('activities',5,'Disseminate research and share ideas');
Insert	into pagetext values ('activities',6,'Together we look forward to a coalition of dedicated champions actively learning and sharing ideas on how schools may help prepare folks for their critically important future roles as parents and other key people in the lives of young children.

Insert	into pagetext values ('phase1',3,'Income-based achievement gaps in cognitive skills such as math and reading are fully substantiated at the time children enter Kindergarten (Reardon, 2013; von Hippel & Hamrock, 2016). Further, children who start behind, tend to stay behind (Stanovich, 1986). Therefore, if we want to prevent these achievement gaps, we need to focus on the early childhood period when the gaps grow the most. Further, parents who know more about parenting and child development and who have a stronger belief that they can make a difference in their child’s development, are more apt to interact with their children in ways that promote learning than parents with less parenting knowledge (Rowe, 2008). While numerous programs target parenting knowledge and practices in low-income families, and this approach has been successful for the small proportion of families who participate, they are costly (St. Pierre et al., 1995). Another approach, one that is both more preventative in nature and potentially more far-reaching, is to provide parenting knowledge to individuals before they become parents while they are still in school. To date, very little scholarly work has been done to show the efficacy of programs to prepare students for parenting and a role in young children’s lives.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('phase1',4,'Our first step in achieving this goal was to ascertain adolescents’ knowledge and understanding of parenting and child development by creating and validating the APKAS (Adolescent Parenting Knowledge and Attitudes Survey) questionnaire and administering it to over 1,000 U.S. high school students. No previous study has attempted to understand what high school students already know and believe about these topics. The questionnaire includes information about child development, the role of parents in children’s learning, and knowledge of basic parenting practices that are associated with healthy childhood outcomes. Through the results of the questionnaire, we have learned that while many high school students hold beliefs consistent with helpful practices with young children and their learning, there is much room for improvement. For example, fewer than 50% of respondents in the sample “Agree Strongly” with statements that indicate they hold beliefs associated with positive outcomes for young children. In addition, it seems that high school students have limited knowledge of developmental milestones. They are unsure of what infants and toddlers are capable of at different ages and seem not to ascribe much agency to young children. Moreover, high school students with less childcare experience, who are not from middle class backgrounds, or who are male are less likely to hold attitudes that would set up their children for future success. Furthermore, high school students report that, by far, they have learned the most about parenting from watching their own parents, and from television and movies next. This is especially troubling, since it is likely that media depictions of the realities of parenthood and of best strategies for promoting healthy development and academic success are lacking.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('phase1',5,'This research suggests there is an opportunity for high schools to serve as a site to improve adolescents’ knowledge and attitudes related to child rearing and development.

Insert	into pagetext values ('statestandards',2,'In 2018, Dr. O’Donnell Weber conducted a systematic analysis of U.S. state education standards to determine whether or not there was any mention of parenting, child development, or any topics related to parenting and child development. Through this process, we learned that, in fact, more than half the states do have at least one academic or vocational standard that touches upon parenting and/or child development. However, very few of these standards require students to learn about how they can foster the cognitive, social, or emotional development of young children. Instead, many of the standards focus on pregnancy, childbirth, and “the responsibilities of parenthood.” Anecdotal evidence suggests that even with standards about parenting and child development in place, many schools are failing to provide students with the opportunity to meet those standards (O''Donnell and Rowe, 2019).');

Insert	into pagetext values ('whatlearned',2,'As part of her dissertation research, E. B. O’Donnell Weber conducted a survey with over one thousand American high school students, the Adolescent Parenting Knowledge and Attitudes Survey. Respondents seem to have overall beliefs about factors that influence child development which are congruent with the research evidence, but much more limited knowledge of specific facts about child development. One way to interpret this is that adolescents’ “orientation” about parenting is correct, but they lack expert knowledge about the matter. For example, participants indicated they have strong beliefs regarding the importance of parents speaking to infants (48% “Strongly Agree” and 35% “), giving children opportunities to speak as well as to listen (46% “Strongly Agree” and 40% “Agree”), and reading to children (38% “Strongly Agree” and 41% “Agree”). However, when asked about items related to how to develop oral language (such as by using full explanations when possible, using word games, or using all kinds of words) participants seemed less sure. These results seem to indicate that while high school students believe that parents should speak to their children often, they are unsure of how to do this, including what kinds of words and activities to use to promote discussion.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('whatlearned',3,'When asked where they learned what it means to be a parent, the majority responded that they learned from their parents. However, the second most common answer was from television or movies, and only 13% responded that they learned what it means to be a parent, at least in part, from a class (participants could—and often did—select more than one answer). In addition, high school students in the sample also did not have much confidence that they will “just know what to do” when they become a parent, indicating that many in the sample don’t have a strong belief that parenting knowledge and skills will come naturally to them, despite society’s implicit assumption that little or no training is needed for parenthood.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('whatlearned',4,'Boys were less likely than girls to answer questions about child development correctly and were less likely to believe in the importance of holding a growth mindset, promoting oral language development, and fostering empathy and social-emotional development, compared with girls. Interestingly, there did not seem to be a difference in knowledge or beliefs among students who live in a state with educational standards related to parenting and child development compared with students who live in a state without such standards. This seems to confirm anecdotal evidence that states are not currently effective at meeting their standards.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('whatlearned',5,'Overall, these results suggest that American adolescents could use more specific knowledge about the responsibilities of parenthood and precisely how they can promote learning in young children.');

Insert	into pagetext values ('whyapply',1,'The early years are important');
Insert	into pagetext values ('whyapply',2,'According to Harvard''s Center on the Developing Child, "early experiences affect the development of brain architecture, which provides the foundation for all future learning, behavior, and health (2021)." Educational experiences including social and emotional learning and the learning environment that parents provide in the early years have been found to be vitally important for later success in school (Hartman, Winsler and Manfra, 2017) and beyond (Janta, van Belle and Steward, 2016) further emphasizing the early years for building a foundation for future learning and life.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('whyapply',3,'Parenting knowledge and practices are important');
Insert	into pagetext values ('whyapply',4,'“Right from birth, babies are actively learning throughout the day. Their learning occurs through the types, amounts, and predictability of visual, auditory, sensory, and social-emotional experiences they have with their parents and other caregivers (Sparling, Ramey and Ramey, 2007, p. 105).” There are consistent robust associations between parents’ practices with children and children’s school readiness skills (Koblinsky, Kuvalanka, and Randolph, 2006; Bater and Jordan, 2017; Rich, Spielberger and D’Angelo, 2012) and many studies have also shown the importance of parenting in children’s development (e.g. Rowe, 2008; Bettencourt, 2016; Quirk, Grimm, Furlong, Nylund-Gibson and Swami, 2016; Jahromi, Guimond, Umana-Taylor, Updegraff and Toomey, 2014; Quirk, Dowdy, Goldstein, and Carnazzo, 2017; Dishion et al., 2008; Rich, Spielberger and D’Angelo, 2012; Rowe, Denmark, Jones Harden, and Stapleton 2016). In summary, parents who know more about parenting and child development and who have a stronger belief or mindset they can make a difference in their child’s development, are more apt to interact with their children in ways promoting learning than parents with less parenting knowledge (Rowe, 2008). Therefore, parenting knowledge is essential for promoting optimal development in children. We believe this applies not only to parents but also to grandparents, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, friends, neighbors, and anyone else who spends time with or makes decisions about children.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('whyapply',5,'The challenge');
Insert	into pagetext values ('whyapply',6,'There are on average hundreds of research reports filed in the U. S. Department of Education’s research database annually on parenting and child development and this has continued for at least the last 20 years (Institute of Education Sciences, 2021). Unfortunately, however, in the U.S. little formal parenting education is typically available to broadly and prospectively bring this valuable information to parents.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('whyapply',7,'A possible solution');
Insert	into pagetext values ('whyapply',8,'One solution that is proactive, potentially cost effective and far-reaching is to provide parenting knowledge to individuals before becoming parents while still in school. States’ apparent interest in preparing students for parenting is clear from the numerous states with curriculum standards on the subject (O’Donnell Weber, 2019). However, little scholarly work has been done to show the efficacy of such programs, and few existing programs take a proactive approach to parenting education.');
Insert	into pagetext values ('whyapply',9,'How might young children benefit by such programs? If their parents teach them Social and Emotional Learning in the early years they might learn in their hearts: “the ability to regulate emotions and behaviors effectively, including managing stress, controlling impulses, motivating themselves and setting and working toward goals.” They might also gain abilities like “communicating clearly, listening actively, cooperating, resisting inappropriate social pressure, negotiating conflict constructively”, and the ability to empathize with others (casel.org 2020). Imagine a world in which children and adults alike have facility for these skills just as for their native languages and imagine if all your colleagues and mine held these skills in their hearts. Imagine such a world where everyone, for example, collaborates well together.');
